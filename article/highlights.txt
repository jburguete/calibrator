MPCOTool, an open source tool to supply parameters of empirical models is presented

Genetic, brute force, iterative and search optimization algorithms are included

The software parallelizes the computations on an easy way

Algorithms and simulation data can be selected from a graphical user interface

The optimization methods are analyzed in six standard analytic test functions
