%%%%%  main body of letter

Please find the electronic version of two companion manuscripts "MPCOTool: an open source software to supply empirical parameters
required in simulation models. I: model and tests" and "MPCOTool: an open source software to supply empirical parameters
required in simulation models. II: practical applications", that we would like to have considered for possible publication in
Computers and Electronics in Agriculture.

This is a submission related to the manuscript previously submitted to the same journal with reference "COMPAG-D-15-00336". The text
has been improved thanks to the suggestions and criticisms in the original revision. In particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item new optimization algorithms based in search direction have been added,
\item a graphical user interface has been created and described,
\item a quantitative analysis of the performance of optimization algorithms in standard analytical test cases has been included,
\item the description of the practical application cases in agriculture has been extended,
\item the material is organized with a more scientific focus.
\end{itemize}

All the new material was leading to an excessively long manuscript that we have decided to split in two complementary papers. The first 
is focused on the description of the optimization/calibration techniques implemented. The second shows their performance and the
information that can be obtained from the tool in practical applications in agriculture.
