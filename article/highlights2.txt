The MPCOTool usage is illustrated by showing four practical applications

Calibration of the empirical coefficients in a surface irrigation model

Calibration of the empircal coefficients in a ballistic sprinkler irrigation model

Calibration of empirical movement parameters of a sprinkler center-pivot model

Optimization of gate opening delays in a canal management
